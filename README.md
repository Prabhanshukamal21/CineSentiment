# CineSentiment
CineSentiment is an end-to-end NLP project that fine-tunes the DistilBERT transformer model to classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative. It leverages Hugging Face's transformers, custom preprocessing with Pandas, and datasets for training and evaluation. Once trained, the model is capable of real-time inference on unseen reviews.
